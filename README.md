# Welcome to the SBX Chess Engine remote repository! 

#### What: SBX is a chess engine that implements a fairly traditional tree search algorithm to play chess with you!

#### How: Install python3, clone this repo, cd into respective directory and enter command **python3 main.py** to play.

#### This is a personal project that I am still developing actively as an exercise in OOP, design, search algorithms, and (eventually) web application.

#### Please do not expect a bug-free implementation, rigorous testing has not been conducted for certain aspects of the program.

#### Some next aspects for this project: (1) Improve evaluation functions, (2) GUI representation, (3) Fully integrated test suite
